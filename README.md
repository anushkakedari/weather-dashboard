# 🌦️ Weather Dashboard

A modern, responsive weather dashboard built using **vanilla JavaScript** that displays real-time weather information using the **OpenWeather API**.  
The app automatically detects the user's location, supports offline mode, and provides an experience similar to mobile weather apps.

## 🔐 API Key Note

This project uses the **public OpenWeather API**.  
API keys are required to run the project locally.

> In frontend-only applications, API keys are visible in the client.  
> This is acceptable for public APIs like OpenWeather.
